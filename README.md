<p>This is essentially a modded Google Maps API exaple to connect to a Fusion Table and append an HTML div to show data from a column. This was done with help of the =CONCATENATE function in Excel. I took the data and concatenated it with HTML tags so that it would show proper HTML. Then, I just called that one column (never could figure out how to call multiple columns) and it would append the div. Then you iframe this into any post you want.</p>
